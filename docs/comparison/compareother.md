## Comparison with other Staking Investment Options

Staking in another Network can produce rewards that range around 3%-10% (after inflation of those tokens). There are many factors that affect that calculation. Staking in Keep Network as an active strategy will outperform all of them at least during the Stakedrop Phase.

Note that all Network Staking Options show % Rewards in Nominal terms, i.e. if you stake in DOT tokens, rewards are in DOT tokens, therefore it is almost impossible to anticipate returns in Fiat currency. Also, these networks have Inflation enabled to pay for these rewards, so both your stake and rewards are diluted. That effect is not shown below, but it is calculated in the [Staking Rewards Site](https://www.stakingrewards.com/) used for  reference.
